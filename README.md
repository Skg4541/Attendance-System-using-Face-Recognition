# Attendance-System-using-Face-Recognition


  
In this project, we have used Face Recognition System to mark the attendance.
  
We have used Python libraries such as OpenCV, dlib and face_recognition.
  
We have formed a dataset (folder named "Images") where we are pre registering the pictures of persons with their name as the filename.

Recognize and manipulate faces from Python with the world's simplest face recognition library.
Built using dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 96.7% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.

This also provides a simple face_recognition tool that lets you do face recognition on a folder of images !
  
 # <h2> Steps of Execution:
    
  1. Install Opencv library.
  2. Install dlib library (Remember to first install dlib library before installing face_recognition). 
  3. Install face_recognition. 
  4. Drop the person's pictures with their name as filename in the "Images" folder before running the code.
  5. Run the test.py file.
